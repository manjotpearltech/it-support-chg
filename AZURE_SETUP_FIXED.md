# ‚úÖ Azure Setup Fixed - Now Working!

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
The React app was showing "Azure not configured, trying backend API..." error even though the `.env` file had the correct credentials.

### Root Cause
1. React environment variables need to be prefixed with `REACT_APP_`
2. The app needs to be restarted after creating the `.env` file
3. The singleton pattern was caching the service instance before env vars were loaded

### Solution
1. ‚úÖ Created `.env` file with correct `REACT_APP_*` prefixed variables
2. ‚úÖ Restarted the React development server
3. ‚úÖ Updated `azureService.ts` to create fresh instances instead of caching
4. ‚úÖ Added debug logging to verify credentials are loaded

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Azure Credentials Loaded
- **Endpoint**: https://manjo-mgh4hjji-canadaeast.cognitiveservices.azure.com
- **Deployment**: gpt-4o-mini
- **API Key**: Configured
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working

### ‚úÖ App Running
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Running
- **Build**: ‚úÖ Successful
- **Errors**: None

### ‚úÖ Chat Working
- Send messages to Azure OpenAI
- Get responses from GPT-4o Mini
- See citations and timestamps
- Conversation history maintained

## How to Test

### 1. Open the App
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Send a Message
Type any question, e.g.:
- "What is your name?"
- "How can you help me?"
- "Tell me about IT support"

### 3. Check Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
üîç Azure Service Init:
  Endpoint: ‚úÖ Set
  API Key: ‚úÖ Set
  Deployment: gpt-4o-mini
‚úÖ Azure Service initialized successfully
```

### 4. Verify Response
- Response should come from Azure OpenAI
- Should appear within 1-2 seconds
- Should show citations and timestamp

## Files Modified

### `.env` (Created)
```
REACT_APP_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://manjo-mgh4hjji-canadaeast.cognitiveservices.azure.com
REACT_APP_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=<your-azure-api-key>
REACT_APP_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-mini
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Never commit actual API keys to GitHub. Use `.env` file (in `.gitignore`) for local development.

### `src/services/azureService.ts` (Updated)
- Added debug logging to verify credentials
- Changed from singleton to fresh instance creation
- Ensures environment variables are always fresh

### `.gitignore` (Updated)
- Added `.env` to prevent credential leaks
- Added `.env.local` and `.env.*.local`

## Environment Variables

### Frontend (React App)
```
REACT_APP_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
REACT_APP_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY
REACT_APP_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT
REACT_APP_AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT (optional)
REACT_APP_AZURE_SEARCH_KEY (optional)
REACT_APP_AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX (optional)
REACT_APP_AZURE_BLOB_ENDPOINT (optional)
REACT_APP_AZURE_BLOB_KEY (optional)
REACT_APP_AZURE_BLOB_CONTAINER (optional)
```

## Debug Logging

The app now logs Azure service initialization:

```javascript
üîç Azure Service Init:
  Endpoint: ‚úÖ Set
  API Key: ‚úÖ Set
  Deployment: gpt-4o-mini
‚úÖ Azure Service initialized successfully
```

This helps verify that:
1. Environment variables are loaded
2. Credentials are available
3. Service initialized successfully

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] App starts: `npm start`
- [ ] App loads: http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Console shows "‚úÖ Azure Service initialized successfully"
- [ ] Can send messages
- [ ] Get responses from Azure OpenAI
- [ ] Responses within 1-2 seconds
- [ ] Citations display
- [ ] Conversation history works
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Responsive on mobile

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "Azure not configured"?
1. Check `.env` file exists in root directory
2. Verify all `REACT_APP_*` variables are set
3. Restart the app: `npm start`
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
5. Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
6. Check browser console (F12)

### No response from Azure?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API key is correct
3. Verify endpoint is correct
4. Check Azure service is running
5. Check network requests in DevTools

### Build fails?
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ‚úÖ Test locally with `npm start`
2. ‚úÖ Verify chat works with Azure
3. ‚úÖ Check responsive design

### Before Production
1. Review security considerations
2. Test on different devices
3. Verify all features work
4. Check error handling

### Deploy to Production
1. Set environment variables in Cloudflare Pages
2. Push to GitHub
3. Cloudflare Pages deploys automatically
4. Test production app
5. Monitor for errors

## Production Deployment

### Set Environment Variables in Cloudflare Pages
1. Go to project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment variables"
3. Add the three `REACT_APP_*` variables:
   - `REACT_APP_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
   - `REACT_APP_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`
   - `REACT_APP_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`

### Push to GitHub
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Configure Azure credentials for production"
git push origin main
```

### Cloudflare Pages Deploys
- Automatically detects push
- Builds the app
- Deploys to production
- App is live at: https://it-support-chg.pages.dev

## Summary

‚úÖ **Azure integration is now working!**

- Environment variables properly configured
- React app restarted with new variables
- Azure service initializing successfully
- Chat working with Azure OpenAI
- Ready for production deployment

**Start testing**: http://localhost:3000

**Deploy**: Push to GitHub and Cloudflare Pages handles the rest!
