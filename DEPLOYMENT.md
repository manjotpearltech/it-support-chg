## 🚀 Cloudflare Pages Deployment

### Build Configuration

Use these settings in your Cloudflare Pages dashboard:

```
Framework preset: Create React App
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: dist
Root directory: (leave empty or /)
```

### Environment Variables

No environment variables are required. The API endpoint is hardcoded to:
```
https://worker.chargercloud.io
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fixed build warnings and added deployment config"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Cloudflare Pages will automatically:**
   - Detect the push
   - Run `npm install`
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Deploy the `dist` folder
   - Make it live at your custom domain

3. **First deployment takes ~2-3 minutes**
   - Subsequent deployments: ~1-2 minutes

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### ESLint Warnings Resolved

1. **Removed unused `sessionIdRef`**
   - The API doesn't require session IDs
   - Cleaned up unused code

2. **Fixed `no-loop-func` warning**
   - Extracted message update logic into helper function
   - Moved `currentContent` outside loop scope
   - Wrapped `simulateStreaming` in `useCallback`

3. **Added missing dependency**
   - Added `simulateStreaming` to `sendMessage` dependency array

### Build Output

- **Before:** Warnings treated as errors in CI
- **After:** Clean build with no warnings ✅

```
Compiled successfully.

File sizes after gzip:
  48.7 kB  build/static/js/main.dd1f8a3e.js
  1.99 kB  build/static/css/main.533293d3.css
```

---

## 🔧 Build Script Changes

### Updated `package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "react-scripts build && cp -r build dist"
  }
}
```

This ensures the build output is copied to `dist` folder for Cloudflare Pages.

### Added `public/_redirects`

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

This enables client-side routing for the React SPA.

## 🌐 Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check Homepage
- Visit your Cloudflare Pages URL
- Should see the welcome screen with gradient title
- Dark theme should be applied

### 2. Test Chat Functionality
- Click an example query or type a question
- Should see streaming response
- Source citations should appear below answers

### 3. Test API Integration
Try these queries:
- "unable to login to okta"
- "How do I reset my Okta password?"
- "VPN connection issues"

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness
- Test on mobile device
- Layout should adapt to smaller screens
- Example queries should stack vertically

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails in Cloudflare

**Issue:** Build command fails
**Solution:** 
- Check build logs in Cloudflare dashboard
- Verify build command is: `npm run build`
- Verify output directory is: `dist`

### Blank Page After Deployment

**Issue:** Page loads but shows blank screen
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `_redirects` file is in `public/` folder
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh

### API Not Working

**Issue:** Chat doesn't respond
**Solution:**
- Open browser DevTools → Network tab
- Check if requests to `https://worker.chargercloud.io` are successful
- Verify CORS is enabled on the API

### Styling Issues

**Issue:** Dark theme not applied
**Solution:**
- Verify `src/index.css` was deployed
- Check browser console for CSS loading errors
- Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
