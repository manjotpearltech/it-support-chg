## ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

### **1. CORS Headers** (2 minutes to fix)
**Current**: Allows all origins (`*`)  
**Recommended**: Restrict to your domain

**File**: `worker/index.js` line 15  
**Change**:
```javascript
// From:
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'

// To:
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://your-domain.pages.dev'
```

**Impact**: Low (works fine as-is, just more secure with specific domain)

---

### **2. Debug Console Logs** (3 minutes to fix)
**Current**: Console logs in production  
**Recommended**: Remove or use environment-based logging

**Files**:
- `src/App.tsx` lines 58-59
- `worker/index.js` lines 44, 69, 82, 207

**Impact**: Very low (cosmetic only, doesn't affect functionality)

---

### **3. Mock Ticket System** (Optional)
**Current**: Ticket creation returns mock data  
**Recommended**: Integrate with real ticketing system (Jira, ServiceNow, Zendesk)

**File**: `worker/index.js` lines 81-94  
**Impact**: Low (tickets are created, just not tracked in real system)

---
